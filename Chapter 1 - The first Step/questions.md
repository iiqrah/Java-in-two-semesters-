## Self-test Questions

### 1. Explain: 

  - program: set of instructions written for the computer to follow to do a task.
  
  - software: a program or a set of programs.
  
  - application software: softawre for the users to perfrom tasks.
  
  - system software: software for the computers to perform tasks.
  
  - machine code: binary code that is produced by the compiler after compiling the source code, only code that is understood by the computer.
  
  - source code: code written by programmers in a semi-English programming language that is not compiled 
  
  - embedded software: software is not just for computers, but also for devices like tvs, cars, watches etc, where the software is built into the device
  
  - compilation: the process of coverting source code to machine code with the help of a system software called compiler
  
  - java byte code: binary code that is produced from the source code by the java compiler that is universal and platform independent
  
  - java virtual machine: special program that converts java byte code into machine code of the specific operating system it is ran on
  
  - integrated development environment: easy to use program that offers windows to: write code, access info about files being used, show errors and allow to run the program as soon as it is compiled
  
### 2. Java compilation vs other compilation

  - Source Code > Java Compiler > Java Byte Code > JVM > Machine Code > Use program
  - Source Code > Compiler > Machine Code > Use program
  
### 3. Types of java programs:

  - Console applications: text based, user input from keyboard
  - Graphical applications: GUI wit text+picture+shapes based, user input from keyboard and mouse
  - Applets: web based application available over the internet that can be run in your web browser
  - Mobile applications: run in your mobile phones
  
### 4. Types of java comments:

  - Single line comments: start with //
  - Multiple line comments: start with /* and end with */
  
### 5. println vs print

  - println stands for print line, outputs whatever is in the bracket and moves the cursor to the next line
  - print outputs whatever is in the bracket and lets the cursor stay in the same position
  
### 6. Predict the Output: 

  - a. 
  ```
  Hello, how are you? Fine thanks.
  
  ```
  
  - b. 
  ```
  Hello, how are you? 
  Fine thanks.
  
  ```
  
   - c. 
  ```
 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
  
  ```
  
  ### 7. Write program with following errors: 
  
  - class does not have a name
  - curly brace missing
  - semi colon missing
  - literal string not enclosed in quotation marks
  - S not capatalized in System.out.println
  
  ```
  public class
  {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
      system.out.println (program has erros)
    }
    
 ```
