# Chapter 1: The First Step

## Notes

### Programs: 

  - Computers are dumb.
  - They always need a set of instructions to follow to do any task.
  - This set of instructions is called a program. 
  
  - Computer programs are stored on electronic chips that:
    - either become a part of the computer
    - or stored externally on hard disks, CDs, USBs etc

### Software: 
  
  - The name given to a perogram or a set of programs that achieve a task.

### Types of Software:

  - Application software
    
    - Programs built for the user to do their job.
    - e.g. : games, music player, text editor etc
      
  - System software
  
    - Special programs built for the computer to do its job. 
    - They are of two types: 
    
      - Operating Systems : 
          - help the user to operate/use the system/computer
          - e.g. : UNIX (Linux, MacOS), Windows,  Ubuntu etc
      - Network Software : 
          - help computers in a netrwork interact with each other
          - e.g. : anti-virus, firewall etc
         
  - Embedded software 
  
    - Programs built for other devices like phones, microwave oven, cars, gaming consoles etc
    - They are built into the device 
    - e.g. : GPS, temperature sensor, auto-lock etc 

### Proramming:
    
    - The task of writing the set of instructions/programs/ softwares 

### Programming Language: 

    - Specific language with proper syntax for the computer to understand these set of instructions

### Types of Programming Language:

  - Object Oriented : Java, Python, C++ etc
  - Procedural : C, COBOL, BASIC etc 
  - Functional : Haskell, Scala etc
