## Notes - Java Programming

### Compiling Java Programs

  - Prior to java, programs could be only run on the specific machine the machine code was translated into
  - However java is platform independent language
  - Achieved by having a special program installed in the computer called Java Virtual Machine or JVM
  - JVM specific to specfic types of operating system
  - Comipling has one additional step
  
  Source Code > Java Compiler > Java Byte Code > JVM > Machine Code > Use Program
  
    - Source Code > Java Compiler > Java Byte Code > JVM on Windows > Machine Code for Windows > Use Program
    - Source Code > Java Compiler > Java Byte Code > JVM on Mac > Machine Code for Mac > Use Program
   
  - Other languages, machine code is sold as software, it is specific to the computer
  - Java, Java Byte code is sold is sold as software, it is universal 
  
### Java Development Kit (JDK)

  - Consists of: 
    - JRE (Java Runtime Environment) : JVM + Java libraries that are pre compiled modules to integrate with your programs
    - Java compiler
    - Other tools
    
 ### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
 
  - easy to use program that provides you with windows for :
    - writing your code
    - information about files that you are using
    - information about the errors in your program
    - allows you to run your program as soon as it is compiled
    
 ### Ways to run your program:
 
  - IDE
  - Command promt:
  
     1. source code saved with .java extention
     2. Compile (javac.exe)

         <code> command: javac program.java </code>

     3. Command will produce java byte code with .class extention
     4. Run program through JVM  (java.exe)

         <code> command: java program </code>

     5. Command will produce machine code that the computer understands and runs.
